##Have you ever wondered what a good resume looks like or are wondering what to include or leave out in yours?
Well, look no further! I will share with you some tips on getting your resume past the screening process and onto the interviewing stages.
If you don't have a resume, let's take a look at this sample resume that contains great formatting, structure and content.
This sample resume is from Gayle McDowell, a promiment and fellow software engineer, known for having internships at Microsoft and Apple and also for her book "Cracking the Coding Interview" where she compiled a variety of programming interview questions and answers. 

I'll now explain why this resume works to give you an idea on how to get started!
This resume is based on a three column format. As you go glance down the resume  and see in the blue box outline, the city, name of the school and attendance date of her education is left, center and right aligned, respectively. This makes it apparent to the recruiter who usually takes no more than 20 seconds looking through a resume. Since there are many applicants for an internship position, probably thousands for bigger companies like Google or Facebook, recruiters don't have the luxury to go through each and everyone's resume carefully and with great detail. As a result, some companies may use a filtering system to computatively throw out resumes that don't meet the basic requirements. So, how can you bypass this filter and make your way past the beginning stages? Take a look at some of the key words highlighted (in pink) in the resume. For example, these terms may be part of the list of "pre-requisites" for a certain position. Shown below is an example of a typical intern application that you would find on a company's career page.

It may not be so clear in the qualifications section what skills you would need for the , however applicants typically notice the key words <b>Job requires to develop java scripts, perl and C code</b> at the end of the job description. This is what scouters usually look for when they are trying to determine if a candidate is the right fit for them. Now you know to include these important words into your resume to emphasize the skills you have in these particular areas.

Backtracking to the yellow square outline, you also notice that in her employment section, the position, company and employment dates are also in the same format as her education. This helps with the consistency throughout the resume and, again, helps recruiters find what they need more easily. Gayle chose to highlight her employment history first because she had many internships, especially at big name companies, and campus jobs. Employers definitely like to see that you have experience working in the industry, which gives candidates an upper hand in adaptability and in experience working in corporate culture. 

In the green box, brief and bullet point descriptions are listed under the positions to give recruiters an idea of what the applicant achieved during the lifetime of their internship. These people looking for talented students can usually tell apart those that are doers and those that are achievers. They can see what kind of impact you've had in your position by also looking at quantitative figures. To judge and measure the impact of candidate's precence in the company, statistics are typically what recruiters look for in a resume. These values can help set apart those that made accomplishments in their prior jobs to those that just fulfilled their basic responsibilities.

Boxed in red is the GPA of the candidate. Usually, this is included if it's higher than 3.0. Besides that, it may be wise to include your major GPA if it is greater than the overall GPA. The GPA is an indicator of how well students perform in their academics and how likely they are to succeed, 

## Why it works
### Red:
* A
* B
* C

### Green:
Achiever, not doer
