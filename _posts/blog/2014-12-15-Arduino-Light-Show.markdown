### Christmas season is coming! Make your own Christmas lights at home with an Arduino and LEDs for energy efficiency and minimal cost!

An [Arduino](http://arduino.cc/) is an inexpensive and portable microcontroller. Microcontrollers are hardware that interacts with the environment through the use of sensors, LEDs, and other hardware components. What makes it special is that it is widely available and well-known to most electronics hobbyist. There are a lot of community-based support and documentation for the Arduino. As a result, it is simple for anyone to get it running in no time.

Let's get started, shall we?

The hardware needed are:
1. Arduino (Available on [Adafruit](http://www.adafruit.com/products/50) and [SparkFun](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11021))
2. Breadboard ([Amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=breadboard))
3. LEDs ([eBay.com](http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_odkw=cheap+light+emitting+diode&_from=R40%7CR40&_osacat=0&_from=R40&_trksid=p2045573.m570.l1313.TR4.TRC2.A0.H0.Xlight+emitting+diode&_nkw=light+emitting+diode&_sacat=0))
4. Resistors ([eBay.com](http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2050601.m570.l1313.TR11.TRC1.A0.H0.Xresistors&_nkw=resistors&_sacat=0))

After purchasing all the material, we can now start our Christmas lights assembly.
First of all, begin by downloading the Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment) which is where we will type our code to the Arduino to control the LEDs.
