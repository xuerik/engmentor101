# What is GitHub?
[GitHub](https://www.github.com) is an online repository where programmers can store backups of their code. GitHub allows 5 private repositories for free accounts and the rest are public. GitHub is a champion of open-source technology and millions of developers have shared their code on the site.

This tutorial will provide the basic and necessary informations to help you get started with creating a website for your projects or for yourself.

## Why is it important to have a website?
A website, not to mention a free one, is very valuable in showcasing and documenting yourself to the world. First of all, employers will be interested in students and those who have an official (Sorry, Facebook) online profile of themselves. The purpose of having a website is to show prospective employers your portfolio of projects which neither a resume or cover letter can do.

We will now begin our tutorial on creating a website with GitHub. No prior experience with HTML, CSS, or JavaScript is needed. However, those who are adept at these languages will have a smoother time with this.
Begin by going on [github.com](https://www.github.com). You will immediately see a sign up form on the home page. If not, visit [here](https://github.com/join) to create an account.

As soon as you have your account created and email confirmed, you can start by creating a repository.
Head over to your profile page which should be in the form of: *https://github.com/USERNAME*
Click on the Repositories tab and press New to make your first repository.
In order to create a website, the repository name must be *YOUR_USERNAME.github.io*
Choose  whether you want it to be public (open-source) or private where only you can see the source code and files you upload.
Finish up by clicking on the **Create repository button**. Congratulations! You've successfully created your first repository on GitHub.

Assuming you have no experience with the previously mentioned web development languages, I will guide you to the automatic page generator. First, head over to your repository page. On the sidebar to the right, find the **Settings** link and click on it. Don't fear the myriad of settings that you see. Scroll down until you see the **GitHub Pages** section. Under that, you want to click on *Automatic page generator*. This will now begin the process of generating your website from a variety of pre-made templates. Skip over the **New user site** page and just scroll down to **Continue to layouts**.

At the top, there will be some themes to choose from. Choose whichever one you like and press **Publish page**.

Now you're all set! I bet you're eager to show to the world your website. Browse to *YOUR_USERNAME.github.io* and viola, there is your very own personal website. But, wait a minute. You need to edit the content that is actually on the website. You can do this by visiting the repository that you made and clicking on *index.html* which is the file containing all the text that you saw earlier. Utilize **ctrl+f** to find what you want to edit.

Have you noticed anything about my website, so far? Yes, if you're thinking what I'm thinking, then you're absolutely right! My website is created entirely from scratch using GitHub and a template that I chose. I had no prior experience with HTML or CSS, but I learned more and more as I tried to modify text, layout and formatting of the website.

You are now strong enough to face the wild, young grasshopper. I will leave with you a few valuable resources to playing around and adding to your website.
